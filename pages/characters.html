  <p class="intro">
Ecological collapse does not happen in a vacuum.  
It summons people — with motives, incentives, egos, fears, hopes and ambitions.
This crisis is not just chemical or biological — it is human. 
The algal bloom revealed a cast of recurring personalities that appear whenever environmental collapse collides with politics, money, and culture. 
Understanding these characters— how they collaborate, clash, amplify, or neutralise one another — is essential if we are to navigate forward rather than repeat the same disaster in a different costume.
The following figures are fictional, allegorical archetypes.
They are not portraits of individuals, but recurring patterns observed whenever these conditions converge.
  </p>

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/dr-algie.png" alt="Dr Algie" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>DR ALGIE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">THE BLOOM ITSELF</p>
    <p>
      Dr Algie is the algal bloom personified — not as a monster, but as a smug, semi-sentient force that thrives on human delay and denial.
Half mad scientist, half provocateur anti-hero. 
</p>
     <p>
       Dr Algie does not see itself as evil.
He is simply a natural response to the conditions provided- neglect, pollution, and imbalance.
He thrives on chaos, mocks human systems, and exposes uncomfortable truths:
that nature does not require permission to react.
       </p>
    <p>
      This character exists to remind us that the bloom is not a villain with
      intent. It is an outcome. It flourishes when nutrients, warming waters,
      political inertia, and industrial runoff align just right.
    </p>
    </div>

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/tinfoilhatman.png" alt="Tin Foil Hatman" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>TIN FOIL HATMAN</h2>
    <p class="archetype">THE CONSPIRACY ENGINE</p>
    <p>
      Angry, clumsy, and loud. Tin Foil Hatman represents the explosion of conspiracies born from silence and institutional absence. He embodies the conspiratorial response to crisis — confident, confusing, and catastrophically wrong. Chinese submarines. Desalination plants. Foul play. Tricks of light, smoke and mirrors. Anything except the boring, uncomfortable scientific truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes political figures like Sarah Game who actively downplayed or undermined the severity of the bloom early on, muddying public discourse and giving misinformation institutional legitimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When officials disappear, Tin Foil Hatman appears and fills the void — pointing fingers at foreigners, submarines, infrastructure, shadow actors, or convenient scapegoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though often harmful, he is a symptom, not the disease.

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/sharkface.png" alt="Shark Face" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>SHARKFACE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">CAPITALISM WITH TEETH</p>
    <p>
      Sharkface is capitalism without camouflage — a shark-headed businessman clutching cash and a cigar, amused by environmental destruction so long as profits remain intact.
He represents corporate influence, extraction logic, and development interests that laugh through destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understands power deeply — and uses it efficiently.
The environment is collateral. Profit is permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This character represents corporate fishing interests, development lobbies, energy giants, and the quiet economic pressures exerted on parliament. Indigenous rights, small communities, and ecosystems are collateral damage. 
    </p>

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/councillorjenny.png" alt="Councillor Jenny" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>COUNCILLOR JENNY</h2>
    <p class="archetype">THE BUREAUCRAT ADRIFT</p>
    <p>
      Local governance. Paperwork. Email chains. Councillor Jenny represents the public servant — overworked, underpowered, risk-averse, and structurally encouraged to defer responsibility upward until it evaporates.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes officials who later claimed they were instructed to pause investigations so as not to complicate the state election. When investigations pause, Jenny signs the form. Not malicious — just exhausted, constrained, and trained to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not villains, but conduits through which inaction quietly becomes policy.

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/dougieb.png" alt="Dougie B" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>DOUGIE B</h2>
    <p class="archetype">THE CHARISMATIC CATALYST</p>
    <p>
      Charismatic. Familiar. Trusted by the public. Dougie B is where culture meets politics. Part celebrity, part activist, part politician. He’s capable of making complex issues feel legible, human — and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mobilises public interest, bridges communities, and carries stories between the grassroots and the spotlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes community figures and grassroots documentarians whose visibility forces public attention. It includes the outspoken Greens MLCs like Tammy Franks and Robert Simms who first mentioned the algal bloom in parliament. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It also includes other champions of algal action like David Spiers, the former state Liberal party leader who’s found re-rentry to the political sphere as a spokesperson for ecological advocacy inspired by the algal bloom. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also in Dougie B’s category is Councillor Jane Mary, who is running for the office of Boothby and was an early voice decrying the state Labor government’s failure to respond to the bloom with timely and meaningful action. She has gone door-to-door in her community speaking with the public about the algal bloom.

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/societyofsnottyscientists.png" alt="Society of Snotty Scientists" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>THE SOCIETY OF SNOTTY SCIENTISTS</h2>
    <p class="archetype">GATEKEEPERS OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
    <p>
    An elite scientific class — well funded, politically adjacent, and often hostile to dissent. Fierce internal rivalries coexist with a united front when public narratives are threatened.
These scientists are calculated, credentialed, and deeply political. Their society controls language, legitimacy, and access to information. 
    </p>
    <p>
   A culture of academic rivalry, scientific hierarchy, and exclusion shape what reaches the public —  often more than the science itself. When the SA government finally opted to speak on the algal bloom issue, these scientists were the official mouthpiece. This archetype reflects how power, sexism, racism, ageism, and academic pecking order shape what science is allowed to say — and what it is not.
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/marineceline.png" alt="Marine Celine" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>MARINE CELINE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Dissenter Scientist</p>
    <p>
      Progressive, communicative, and frequently sidelined. Marine Celine speaks directly to the public — and pays the price. She represents those who step outside elite structures, choosing engagement over insulation.
    </p>
    <p>
Marine Celine is a scientist who refuses to stay silent. People-facing, empathetic, and often ostracised by the elite for engaging communities directly. These figures balance integrity with ambition, activism with expertise, and often become lightning rods for both hope and resentment.

  <section class="character">
    <div class="character-inner">
    <img src="images/vinnyspeaks.png" alt="Vinny Speaks" class="character-img" />
    <div class="character-text">
    <h2>PREMIER VINNY SPEAKS</h2>
    <p class="archetype">THE POLISHED PUPPET</p>
    <p>
      Charming. Preened. Empty. Premier Vinny Speaks is the smiling face of state power — a charismatic and disciplined mouthpiece deeply entangled with commercial interests. Vinny speaks fluently — often without saying much at all. He balances donors, optics, and timing, while accountability quietly waits its turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     This archetype represents leaders like the SA Labor Premier who preaches about responsibility while legislating against public protest, protecting political donors and allegedly delaying investigations into the bloom.
