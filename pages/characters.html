  <p class="intro">
    This crisis is not just chemical or biological — it is human.
    The algal bloom revealed a cast of recurring personalities that appear
    whenever environmental collapse collides with politics, money, fear,
    ego, and hope.
    Understanding these characters — how they collaborate, obstruct,
    amplify, or neutralise one another — is essential if we are to navigate
    forward rather than repeat the same disaster in a different costume.
  </p>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>DR ALGIE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Bloom Itself / Comic Anti-Hero</p>
    <p>
      Dr Algie is the algal bloom personified — not as a monster, but as a smug,
      semi-sentient force that thrives on human delay and denial. Half mad
      scientist, half accidental god, Dr Algie does not see itself as evil.
      It simply responds to the conditions provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      This character exists to remind us that the bloom is not a villain with
      intent. It is an outcome. It flourishes when nutrients, warming waters,
      political inertia, and industrial runoff align just right.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>TIN FOIL HATMAN</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Misdirector / Chaos Engine</p>
    <p>
      Tin Foil Hatman embodies the conspiratorial response to crisis — loud,
      confident, angry, and catastrophically wrong. Chinese submarines.
      Desalination plants. Lighting tricks. Anything except the boring,
      uncomfortable truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes political figures who actively downplayed or
      undermined the severity of the bloom early on, muddying public discourse
      and giving misinformation institutional legitimacy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>SHARKFACE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">Capital / Corporate Power</p>
    <p>
      Sharkface is capitalism without camouflage — a shark-headed businessman
      clutching cash and a cigar, amused by environmental destruction so long
      as profits remain intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      This character represents corporate fishing interests, development
      lobbies, energy giants, and the quiet economic pressures exerted on
      parliament. Indigenous rights, small communities, and ecosystems are
      collateral.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>COUNCILLOR JENNY</h2>
    <p class="archetype">Bureaucracy / Local Government</p>
    <p>
      Councillor Jenny represents the public servant — overworked, underpowered,
      risk-averse, and structurally encouraged to defer responsibility upward
      until it evaporates.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes officials who later claimed they were instructed
      to pause investigations. Not villains, but conduits through which inaction
      quietly becomes policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>DOUGIE B</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Charismatic Bridge</p>
    <p>
      Dougie B is where culture meets politics. Part celebrity, part activist,
      part fallen or rising politician. Charismatic, relatable, and capable of
      making complex issues feel human — and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype includes community figures, outspoken Greens MLCs,
      disgraced politicians attempting re-entry through ecological advocacy,
      and grassroots documentarians whose visibility forces public attention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>THE SOCIETY OF SNOTTY SCIENTISTS</h2>
    <p class="archetype">Gatekeepers of Knowledge</p>
    <p>
      An elite scientific class — well funded, politically adjacent, and often
      hostile to dissent. Fierce internal rivalries coexist with a united front
      when public narratives are threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype reflects how power, sexism, racism, ageism, and academic
      hierarchy shape what science is allowed to say — and what it is not.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>MARINE CELINE</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Dissenter Scientist</p>
    <p>
      Marine Celine represents scientists who refuse to stay silent. Public-facing,
      empathetic, and often ostracised by the elite for engaging communities
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      These figures balance integrity with ambition, activism with expertise,
      and often become lightning rods for both hope and resentment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="character">
    <h2>PREMIER VINNY SPEAKS</h2>
    <p class="archetype">The Polished Puppet</p>
    <p>
      Premier Vinny Speaks is the smiling face of state power — charismatic,
      disciplined, and deeply entangled with commercial interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      This archetype represents leaders who speak of responsibility while
      legislating against protest, delaying investigations, and protecting
      donors. Not cartoon villains — far more dangerous than that.
