    <p><strong>Hi. I’m Azzy.</strong> I’m a marine illustrator and snorkeller — and for years, the Gulf was my studio, my happy place, and, honestly, my therapy. I spent years drawing and swimming alongside the creatures of South Australia’s Gulf. Then they began washing up dead.</p>

    <p><strong>Let’s be clear:</strong> the algal bloom was not just gross. It was catastrophic.</p>

    <p>We saw mass marine death on a scale that should have dominated front pages daily — dolphins, rays, sharks, fish of every kind, washing up dead along South Australia’s shores. People were tripping over corpses on their morning beach walks. Surfers came out of the water coughing, eyes stinging. Dogs came home from swims with blood streaming from their noses. It wasn’t subtle. It was apocalyptic.</p>

    <p class="verdict">
      If you want to govern this Gulf, then the life within it is your responsibility.
    </p>

    <p><strong>And I’m not going to stand by while you let it die.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>So get on board with fixing this. Or get the hell out of the way.</strong></p>
