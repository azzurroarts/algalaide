      MANIFESTO OF A MARINE ARTIST
    </div>

    <section class="manifesto">

      <p>Hi. I’m Azzy. I’m a marine illustrator and snorkeller — and for years, the Gulf was my studio, my happy place, and, honestly, my therapy. I spent years drawing and swimming alongside the creatures of South Australia’s Gulf. Then they began washing up dead.</p>

      <p>Let’s be clear: the algal bloom was not just gross. It was catastrophic.</p>

      <p>We saw mass marine death on a scale that should have dominated front pages daily — dolphins, rays, sharks, fish of every kind, washing up dead along South Australia’s shores. People were tripping over corpses on their morning beach walks. Surfers came out of the water coughing, eyes stinging. Dogs came home from swims with blood streaming from their noses. It wasn’t subtle. It was apocalyptic.</p>

      <p>Marine scientists knew something was wrong. They said so.</p>

      <p>And what followed was silence. For months. All year. No statements, no visible action, no urgency — not even an Instagram story. Just a creepy bureaucratic shrug while locals screamed into the void and were met with nothing in return.</p>

      <p>That silence created a vacuum — and into it rushed the conspiracy theorists.</p>

      <p>In the absence of leadership, a circus emerged: Chinese warships, desalination plants, lighting tricks in underwater photography — fuck, probably Labubus next. And honestly? I get it. When the water you swim in starts poisoning everything it touches, people get desperate for answers.</p>

      <p>This is what happens when officials go missing in action.</p>

      <p>Had leaders stood up early — with clarity, honesty, and urgency — people might not have been left piecing together reality from Facebook reels and TikTok speculation. People will always make their own stories when no one gives them the truth.</p>

      <p>Eventually, there was talk of “investigations” and “cleanup funding.” Better than nothing, sure. But you don’t mop up a mass ecological collapse with a grant and a press release. You don’t resurrect a dead reef with budget allocations. No amount of money can buy back the marine life that was lost from our Gulf.</p>

      <p>And this was never just about marine life.</p>

      <p>It was about the future of this state. Recreational fishing — gutted. Eco-tourism — cooked. Watersports and sunset swims — deep fried. Community connection to the coastline — poisoned, literally and spiritually.</p>

      <p>If the reef goes, thousands of livelihoods go with it. And so does the soul of this place.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the federal government debated whether this was a “state issue,” as if algae hits a border and politely checks jurisdiction. The water didn’t know or care who was in office. The Gulf didn’t give a flying fffish about chains of command.</p>

      <p>If it’s in your country, it’s your responsibility.</p>

      <p>This was never political. It was ecological collapse. It transcended parties, platforms, and PR spin. And the longer blame was passed like a hot potato, the closer we edged toward the point of no return — the kind of loss no parliamentary bill could ever undo.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t just sad. I was furious.</p>

      <p>This was the kind of event people will study for decades, asking how it was allowed to unfold in slow motion while those in charge refreshed inboxes and waited for permission to act. The Gulf is the beating heart of this state, and we watched it suffocate in real time. All it ever asked for was oxygen and respect.</p>

      <p>So to the decision-makers: wake up. Stop waiting for more reports of the obvious while fish rot into the sand. Start listening to the people who live with the water — fishers, divers, scientists, and weirdos like me who spend weekends painting Leafy Seadragons.</p>

      <p>Suddenly it’s been claimed that the algal bloom is gone — just in time for summer.</p>

      <p>Since then, disturbing reports have emerged suggesting public servants were instructed to postpone further investigation of the algal bloom until after the election. Whether through delay, denial, or quiet deferral, accountability appeared to be treated as a scheduling inconvenience.</p>

      <p>This story is far from over. The algal bloom is still a real, living creature of a problem.</p>

      <p>And I intend to drag it — kicking and screaming — straight into the middle of this year’s state election dance, and hold anyone seeking public office to account for their role in it.</p>

      <p class="verdict">If you want to govern this Gulf, then the life within it is your responsibility.</p>

      <p class="verdict">And I’m not going to stand by while you let it die.</p>

      <p class="verdict">So get on board with fixing this. Or get the hell out of the way.</p>
